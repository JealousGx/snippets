# Vite (React) Navbar

![Code Snippets](https://res.cloudinary.com/jealousgx/image/upload/v1661260257/snippets-cover_vui9x0.png)
The Navbar is actually responsive, however, the `window.innerWidth` is causing the component not to be responsive. So, to get the responsiveness, after resizing the browser, refresh the page, everything should be fine.

<div align="center">
  <h3>
    <a href="https://react-navbar-zeta.vercel.app">
      Demo
    </a>
  </h3>
</div>
