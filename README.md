Code Snippets are a great way to share code that you have written and want to share with others. This is one of the platforms that you can use to share code. You can share code snippets with other people and ask them to help you with your code.

Code Snippets can be in any language. You can share code snippets in Python, Java, C, C++, C#, PHP, JavaScript, Ruby, Go, Rust, Scala, and many other languages. Following are the languages that I will be sharing code snippets in: Feel free to update the following list as you add more languages.

- Python
